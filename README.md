# Project explanation:

School Administration is a small project to demonstrate my abilities to interact with a relational database (RDBMS), in this case, the Micrsoft SQL Server. I have used Oracle database in the past but I used the Microsoft one since it is highly compatible with Visual Studio (with C#).
